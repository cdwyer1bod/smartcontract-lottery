1. Users enter lottery with ETH based on a USD fee
2. An admin will choose when the lottery is over
3. Lottery will select a random winner

Since there is an admin, it is not truly decentralized *yet*

How do we test this?

1. `mainnet-fork` since we only working with off-chain contracts
2. `development` with mocks
3. `testnet`
